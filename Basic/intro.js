//latest is ES2015/ES6
// ES6 is also known as ECMAScript 2015 as it is released in 2015. 
//There are two new ways to define variables that are let and const. 
// An arrow function is a new feature introduced in ES6 by which we donâ€™t require the function keyword to define the function.

// Declarartion and Initialization
// var x = 10
// var x = "abhi"
// console.log(x)

// var x;
// x=10;
// x=20;
// var x=30;

// let x=10;
// let x=30; here when u execute the code it will throw error(syntax error).
//because we cant redeclared once the variable is declared already with let keyword
//let:cant be redeclared but can be initialized again n again

//const x;
// x=10 while executing like this will error.
// in case of const keyword Declarartion and Initializationare done at the sametime.like const a=10
// and you cant redeclared and reinitialized
